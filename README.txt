Coverage Criteria Demonstrated :
		Edge coverage
		Prime Path coverage
Tools Used: 
 		JUnit 4.13

The project consists of functions covering different topics, such as Arithmetic, Maths, Searching and Sorting. It is a Java based console application that is split up into 4 packages each containing amalgamation of codes, such that we can aptly demonstrate various scenarios like- loops, loops+conditionals, conditional within loops, loops within conditionals, switch cases with conditionals, nested conditionals etc, thereby attempting to make the source code rich in control flow structure.

	Operations
	AdvancedOperations
